# Orbiter tileedit project

*tileedit* is a texture tile viewer and editor for [Orbiter Space Flight Simulator] (http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk).

It can be used to navigate the quadtree texture layers for planetary surface rendering introduced in Orbiter 2016. It also contains some rudimentary editing capabilities for elevation tiles.

tileedit is written in C++ and based on Qt to provide the user interface. The previous Matlab-based implementation is now obsolete and retained for reference.
