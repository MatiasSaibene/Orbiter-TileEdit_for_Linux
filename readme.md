# Orbiter tileedit project

*tileedit* is a MATLAB-based planetary texture tile viewer and editor for [Orbiter Space Flight Simulator] (http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk).

It can be used to navigate the quadtree texture layers for planetary surface rendering introduced in Orbiter 2016. It also contains some rudimentary editing capabilities for elevation tiles.
